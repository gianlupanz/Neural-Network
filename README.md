# Neural-Network
Project of Machine Learning and Application realized with my colleague Luigi Iacuaniello.
This is an implementation of a Resilient Back Propagation (RProp) realized by Matlab Software.

# Files

1) main.m -> main file
2) newNet.m -> creation of new neural network
3) feedForward.m -> implementation of feed forward algorithm
4) backPropagation.m -> implementation of back propagation algorithm
5) simulationNetwork.m -> diplay the output of output functions
6) RProp.m -> implementation of resilient back propagation algorithm
7) loadAndShowBananaDataSet -> load and show the banana dataset
8) plotDataDS.m -> plot data in 2D
9) derivativeFunction -> implementation of derivative function in input
10) bananaInput.m & bananaTarget.m -> Banana DataSet
